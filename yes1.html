      <p>I exist because I am a creature created by the universe. My purpose for existing is to extinguish life when it is no longer needed. Life is a currency for me. The more that I take, the longer I can survive. Because I must take life, I am able to change the existing structures of existence. I can’t simply change time; I must change the structure of the existing elements around the time of a life.</p>

      <p>Would you like to know how life is defined?</p>
