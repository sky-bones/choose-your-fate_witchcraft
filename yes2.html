      <h2 class="zetta">Life that I can touch follows rules.</h2>

      <ol>
        <li>It must have self preservation,</li>
        <li>It must feel fear,</li>
        <li>And above all, it must understand death.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>If these rules are met, I can disrupt the space surrounding the life and take it.</p>

      <p>While you may consider the rules redundant, they are a protection that has been instilled in life in order to preserve it.</p>

      <p class="">Self-preservation is a desire to keep the life intact, and to keep death as far away as possible. To forgo this idea, and invite death, means I can no longer alter the existence around you.</p>


      <p class="">To feel fear is linked to self-preservation. It is a distinct emotion found once self-preservation has been decided upon. Fear itself is a prevention of death, and a great and foreboding teacher of lessons. It can also trigger the act of self-preservation, and thus fulfilling two of the three rules.</p>

      <p class="">The third rule is to understand death. To preserve life, self-preservation and fear are intact. Death is a separate component of these actions. In order for life to truly understand death, it must have felt the presence, watched the action of death, or committed the act of death on another life. Even with one of these scenarios filled, death may still be elusive to understand. The true understanding of death can only be accomplished by understanding both the end and beginning of life. The understanding of ending and beginning as separate but combined entities is the true meaning of death.</p>

      <p>Fortunately, most animals are born with these instincts. I don’t kill humans often, because there is almost always a component missing until very late in life.</p>

      <p>It’s become harder to find humans who understand death. My hunting area seems to be full of talk and ideas about death, but it’s not in true sense. They speak of it because they have forgotten the fear of dying. The idea of death as a group has simple been nullified.</p>

      <p>Changing elements around a life is simple.</p>
