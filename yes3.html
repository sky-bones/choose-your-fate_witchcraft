    <h2 class="zetta">The elements are simply particles.</h2>

    <p>In order to change the surroundings, I simple change the particles.</p>

    <p>I am a witch after all.</p>

    <p>I can light fires in the air, by changing the elements. I can cause a tree to fall, by increasing the decomposing elements in its structure.</p>

    <p>In a sense, I can control anything made of particles.</p>

    <p>It’s a bit all-powerful. Whatever universal rule created me, created those rules in order to protect most life from being changed around. I suppose it makes it fair.</p>

    <p>But I’m not invincible. I am mortal, but the span of my existence is much greater then the average one. It can continue as long as my rules can be applied to a life. I try to take only the amount of lives necessary to continue on.</p>

    <p>Now I suppose I should make this fair.</p>

    <p>You know how I can remove your life, and you should be able to remove mine. However my conditions are met, they will be met. I can take your life with you realizing that you have met the conditions.</p>

    <p>Would you like to know how to take my life?</p>
