    	<p>However you choose to do it, they are both inevitably going to begin and end. There is something sneeringly indifferent about the universe in that context, the idea that life—the epitome of our apparent existence—can vanish and begin at random intervals.</p>

    	<p>Even if you can be born from the salt of the ocean, as a creature that shouldn’t exist, your life hangs in the delicate thread of time.</p>

    	<p>That is how I see my life. My perspective is perhaps larger then the average life, simply because I do not have the capacity of emotion. The grandness of that was the logical and wonderful patterns that could be seen in the threads of time.</p>

    	<p>I am a witch.</p>

    	<p>Would you like to continue to hear the story?</p>
