        <p class="">However you choose to do it, they are both inevitably going to begin and end. There is something sneeringly indifferent about the universe in that context, the idea that life – the epitome of our apparent existence – can vanish and begin at random intervals.</p>

        <p>Even if you can be born from the salt of the ocean, as a creature that shouldn’t exist, your life hangs in the delicate thread of time.</p>


        <p>That is how I see my life. My perspective is perhaps larger then the average life, simply because I do not have the capacity of emotion. The grandness of that was the logical and wonderful patterns that could be seen in the threads of time.</p>
