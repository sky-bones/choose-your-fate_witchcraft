            <p>I am not capable of fear. By giving you information, it simple makes my hunting more interesting. I hunt to survive, and I survive to hunt. There is no way to beg my forgiveness. By giving you information, you may create your own change. You might invite death. You might seek out a witch.</p>

            <p>Humans are unpredictable. Perhaps you will extinguish me. Perhaps I will get to you first.</p>
