<h2 class="zetta">I am not capable of fear.</h2>

  <p>By giving you this information, it simply makes my hunting more interesting. I hunt to survive, and I survive to hunt. There is no way to beg my forgiveness. By giving you information, you may create your own change. You might invite death. You might seek out a witch.</p>

  <p>Humans are unpredictable. Perhaps you will extinguish me. Perhaps I will get to you first.</p>
