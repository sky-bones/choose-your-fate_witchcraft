          <p>Ah, the true nature of humanity. The curiosity and ability to learn and change is a strength my species no longer posses. We have been created from the depths of ocean salt, and crumbled together with sulfur from high peaks. I am created from the elements of the universe.</p>

          <p>In order to extinguish my life, you would need to understand my blood. As a creature based on the element of salt, my blood is both salt and carbon based. I bleed red, but I cannot create more blood cells.</p>

          <p>In assuming you can simply bleed me to death, you would only be half correct. Without blood, I would be slower and be incredibly weary.</p>

		      <p>But I can live without blood. A salt-based creature can be killed by changing its’ element. In order to change salt, you must make it dissolve.</p>

          <p>The old story of witches melting was true. I will melt once my blood has been drained from my body.</p>

          <p>A bleeding witch is a dead one.</p>

          <p>You have everything you could need to know.</p>

          <p>Would you like to know why I’ve told you all this?</p>
