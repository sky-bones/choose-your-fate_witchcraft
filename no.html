    <div id="first-n">
        <p class="">By not knowing, you may have avoided a great mental blow. Or you may suffer a greater one by not knowing.</p>

        <p class="">That choice is up to you.</p>
    </div>

        <div id="second-n">
            <p class="">I commend your honesty. You will live much longer I suppose, by making decisions that will extend both your life and the life of your opposite.</p>
            <p class="">Your thread of time will extend further then you imagined.</p>
        </div>

            <div id="thrid-n">
                <p class="">With your new found information, you cannot forget that you life hangs in the balance. However, this has unlocked a new condition.</p>

                <p class="">Because I have created the understanding, the other two conditions will be fulfilled.</p>

                <p class="">But because I have triggered the event, the condition of understanding life has been created to protect you.</p>

                <p class="">Because this is a life long journey, the possibility of changing your surrounding elements has become impossible.</p>

            </div>

                <div id="fourth-n">

                    <p class="">Perhaps it is best. To be given understanding that could allow you to be extinguished, can be qualified in my conditions. Your life line will extend, but I am much closer to changing the elements surrounding you.</p>

                </div>

                    <div id="fifth-n">

                        <p class="">Your understanding is not complete enough to activate my power. But I welcome the chance to see your time thread extend.</p>

                    </div>
